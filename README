### Data Representation TTA

#### Task

- Clean raw data to get hourly Google Trends data on bitcoin

#### Time

- Took me about ~ 1 h 30 mins in total

#### Idea
- As descirbed in the problem, value_hour is rescaled with respect to week and value_week is rescaled with respect to month, so we can use value_week and value_month as scalling factors to get real value_hour
- merge weekly data and monthly data onto hourly data and foward fill NA values to propagate the scalling factors. Then multiply all three values together.

#### Instructions
- make sure pandas and matplotlib is installed
    - pip install pandas
    - pip install matplotlib
- run 'python main.py'
